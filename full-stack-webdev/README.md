# Full stack web development project

This project more-or-less runs the gamut of creating a website for
yourself - broken down into several stages and cutting across most
aspects of modern development.

It is not a short project, and it is probably not the easiest project
to rush through all at once. This is a journey more than anything else -
finish goals whenever you think you are ready for them, not just to
get things done.

What having a website means differs between people, but a big selling
point is that it showcases who you are as a person and as a developer.
A website which isn't interactive but has a rock-solid content management
system is just as valid as having a website where load times are negligible
for showcasing your talents.

In an ideal world though, your website can do both, and you can point
recruiters towards it and say '_I made this from scratch_'. It usually
helps.

## Aims

By the end of this project, you should:
- Have a basic understanding of all aspects covered by this project
- Be able to describe the difference between front-end development,
  back-end development, and full-stack development
- Have your own website!

## Structure

This is a big project and will start simple, but get progressively
harder and larger over time.

> **A comment on language**
>
> Everyone has their own favourite language for web development.
> Wars have been fought over these things. In the end, there is no real
> right answer to the question of 'What should I make _x_ in', there is
> only what you feel the most comfortable using.
>
> There are _recommended_ languages for this, but that's because a lot
> of time has gone into making it easier to make websites with certain
> tools. For each section, I will recommend a couple of languages and
> frameworks to use, but other options are available if you so choose.
>
> All the examples for this project _will_ be in Node.JS though.

### 1. Tell the world who you are

The first thing that people notice about any website really is how
it looks.

This segment looks at creating a basic set of web pages for you to
describe yourself in.

_Skill words: HTML, stylesheets_

### 2. One app to rule them all

So... simple is somewhat relative. The next step to make a website is
to make it easier to access.

This segment looks at creating a basic webserver to serve your basic
pages to any visitors to your site.

_Skill words: HTTP, Server-client, TDD_

### 3. Haven't we done this before?

One of the things you may have noticed during stage 1 is that there is
a _loooot_ of repetition between your HTML files. `<head></head>` tags
are not known for changing too often between pages, and the general
design of most sites stays constant throughout.

This segment looks at introducing templates and templating to your
site to reduce repetition and to make adding new pages easier.

_Skill words: templates, HTML, design hierarchy_
